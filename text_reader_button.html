        The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. 
        She sells seashells by the seashore. 
        A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. 
        Better late than never. 
        Actions speak louder than words. 
        All that glitters is not gold. 
        Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. 
        Birds of a feather flock together. 
        Fortune favors the bold. 
        Practice makes perfect.
